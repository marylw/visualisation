# Visual Analytics Dashboard

This project is a Dash-based interactive dashboard for visualizing and analyzing radiation sensor data in St. Himark. It combines static and mobile sensor readings, spatial hotspot maps, and daily decision recommendations.

## Features

- **Sensor Data Visualization:**  
  View scatter plots and bar plots for static, mobile, or combined sensor data.

- **Hotspot Maps:**  
  Interactive maps display radiation hotspots for both static and mobile sensors, shown side by side.

- **Daily Recommendations:**  
  Select a day to view cleaning, decontamination, shelter, and sensor deployment recommendations in a clear, formatted text and table.

- **Caching:**  
  Expensive data processing steps are cached for faster app startup.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/)
- pandas
- geopandas
- plotly
- joblib
- Pillow
- shapely
- scipy

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install dash pandas geopandas plotly joblib pillow shapely scipy
```

## Usage

1. **Prepare Data:**  
   Place all required CSV and shapefile data in the `MC2/data/` directory as expected by the code.

2. **Run the App:**  
   ```
   python app.py
   ```
   The dashboard will be available at [http://127.0.0.1:8050/](http://127.0.0.1:8050/).
